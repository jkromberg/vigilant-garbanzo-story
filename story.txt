A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was a dude named Bill.
Bill was a seafaring man who lived alone on his yacht. He spent his days
fishing away and hadn't stepped foot off his yacht in 4 years. Bill loved 
his yacht so much he wouldn't know what to do without it, thats why he
named his it "Titanic 2." One fine summer day Bill found himself fishing as
he normally did. This time Bill was so focused on fishing, he didn't notice
the iceberg about to collide with his ship until it was too late. *CRASH* "Oh
no! we're sinking!" Bill exclaimed.
